This folder contains the geometry and module map inputs required by the main LST algorithm. These files are generated from the [LSTGeometry](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/LSTGeometry) repository and are organized by their outer tracker (OT) and inner tracker (IT) version as well as the pT cut used to generate the module map and pixel map.
